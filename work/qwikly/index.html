      <h2>Build iOS apps within Sketch</h2>
      <p class="larger"><a target="_blank" href="http://getqwikly.com">Qwikly</a> is a Sketch plugin that helps users convert designs into fully-functional iOS applications. By enabling users to add interactions and data to elements within Sketch, Qwikly removes unnecessary barriers between design and code in app development.</p>

      <h5>The project</h5>
      <p class="larger">As a design-oriented product, Qwikly's founders were seeking guidance from designers with Sketch experience to help hone their vision. In close collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="http://nguyentin.com">Tin Nguyen</a>, we established a company identity and provided product design and direction through multiple early iterations of the product.</p>

      <h6>New identity</h6>
      <p class="smaller">Drawing inspiration from Qwikly's goal of easing transitions between things—designers and developers, design and code—our logo design subtly conveys bringing ideas to life.</p>

    <div>
      <h6>A design system</h6>
      <p class="smaller">To help the Qwikly team develop while maintaining design integrity beyond the scope of our project, we created a complete identity guide with logo usage specifications, app icons, color palette, fonts and usage guidelines.</p>

      <h5>Bridging the gap</h5>
      <p class="larger">By handing off a lot of dev thinking to designers, the UI had a lot of ground to cover. We looked for creative ways to simplify the workflow and lower the comprehension barrier.</p>

      <h6>The interactions pane</h6>
      <p class="smaller">At the heart of Qwikly's concept was the interactions pane that enables users to add gestures, like taps and swipes, to Sketch elements, then define what actions are performed. Our UI design makes this completely intuitive.</p>
