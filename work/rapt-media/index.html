      <h2>An interactive video creation platform</h2>
      <p class="larger">The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raptmedia.com">Rapt Media Composer</a> is a cloud-based editing suite for creating branching, interactive videos. Blurring the distinction between video and the rest of the web, Rapt Media’s interactive videos increase viewer engagement by letting them control their experience.</p>

      <h5>The project</h5>
      <p class="larger">Work closely with Rapt Media’s Engineering team to completely redesign the Composer, aiming to significantly improve the UX during their refactor from Ruby on Rails to ReactJS. From sign up to project publish, nearly every piece of the app was reassessed and updated.</p>
      <p class="smaller">Please note that this project was performed under the employment of Rapt Media.</p>

      <h2>A familiar UI for an unfamiliar market</h2>
      <p class="larger">A challenge for interactive video is its relative unfamiliarity in the market place. We didn't want to add unnecessary friction for project authors by providing them with an unfamiliar UI. So we researched what other software they're using and built our interface off some of the common patterns we found. Then we simplified.</p>

      <h6>Everything in the right place</h6>
      <p class="smaller">We ensured that users are never left searching for information or a feature. Through wireframing and prototyping we were able to find the right place for every feature. While keeping an eye on their media upload progress they can be working on other aspects such as building out their video's paths.</p>

Working hand-in-hand with Rapt's engineers, we created a UI that thoroughly embraces the technology it's built upon while enabling forthcoming features to increase the usability, not damage it.</p>
